# EnvyStatsGLOBAL


You can get the global statistics of the users (If the profile is in public)

To install it on your unturned server, drag the .DLL into Rocket / Plugins. Restart the server

Inside Rocket / Plugins / Envy you will find the configuration where you have to put this steam key (https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey)

Commands:

/ statsglobal <ID>

Perms:

statsglobal


To use the console application (Only on windows) you have to run the program from the system symbol or from the powershell

The first step is to add the key using -k <Key>
then you add the Steam64Id without adding -k or any other parameter.
